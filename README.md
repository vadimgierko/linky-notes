## How efficiently use *linky_notes*?

Although the *linky_notes* app has only a few simple functionalities,
it offers **endless possibilities** for organizing, searching and using your notes in the way,
which is impossible to many other note apps around.

Those functionalities are:
- adding one or more **tags** to each note,
- the ability to **filter** your notes *by* one or more *tags*,
- markdown editor, which enables **links** adding to your notes,
- each note has its own link (URL).

The way you can organize & filter your notes using those features is very **customizible**.
You can use my tips mentioned in my [app guide](https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/app-guide) or **create your own system**!

## Motivation (problem I wanted to solve & solution)

I've made this app first of all for my own needs. I read a lot, create a lot (developing different knowledge-based projects) and... do a lot of notes:

- using different techniques, like: mindmapping, sketchnoting, Cornell Note Taking method
- noting on different materials, like: paper, books pages, phone, laptop
- storing notes... everywhere

So...

### Problem

I couldn't manage & organize thousands of my paper & digital notes properly (I have developed my own system, but it's too far from what I need). So I've tried a few note apps, but none of them where satisfying - something always was missing.

### Solution

I've understood, that I need to:

- have all notes (paper & digital) in one place
- organize them by tags, because my paper notes were in so many folders and places & also sometimes some notes were needed to be in a few project folders in the same time

So I've decided to build this note app & solved one of my biggest problems thanks to my own app. Now my notes are tagged, organized & easy to find/ filter.

And when I've tested the app, I've decided to share it with the world to let everybody to build an easy to use, but effiecient knowledge/ notes base! Sign up & try here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/!
