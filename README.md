## Motivation

I've made this app first of all for myself. I read a lot, create a lot and... do a lot of notes.

I couldn't manage thounsands of my paper & digital notes, tried a few note apps, but none of them where satisfying. I've understood, that I need to have all notes (paper & digital) in one place & organize them by tags, because my paper notes were in so many folders and places & also sometimes some notes were needed to be in few project folders in the same time.

So I've decided to build this note app & solved one of my biggest problems thanks to my own app. Now my notes will be tagged, organized & easy to find/ filter.
