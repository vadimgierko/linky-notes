# linky_notes app

### This SPA allows you to create notes with keywords, which works similarly to tags.

Thanks to that:
- your notes are linked with each other by keywords
- they are grouped
- same note can be in a few keywords groups
- you don't need to put them in folders or do any index or table of content
- that is easy to find the particular note by choosing keywords they consist in search field
- you are saving a tone of time to organize & efficiently use them

At the moment this SPA is only available `for my personal use` - you can see my notes, but cannot sign up or modify my database. I've implemented only basic core features for the moment, but app is still growing & is tested.

At the moment, I can:
- sign in
- add, update & delete notes when logged
- see a list of all items
- switch dark/light mode

### Technologies I've used in this project:
- React 17
- React Router 5.2
- React Context & useContext
- Firebase 9.1 (authentication, realtime database, storage)
- Bootstrap 5.1
