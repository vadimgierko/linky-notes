## How efficiently use linky_notes?

- always add at least one tag to your note (or you won't be able to find it without using ctrl-f or group it with other notes)
- try to add tags that not only define the content of a given note, but also define the embedding of this content in a broader context, e.g. if your note is about creating a function in JavaScript (this is a programming language), add tags: "function", "creating function", "javascript", "programming languages", "frontend", "learning" etc.
- try to add tags containing the description of the type of note, e.g. "quote", "idea", "definition", "question",
- try to add tags containing the description of the project / area of ​​interest that this note refers to, e.g. "learning programming", "productivity", "meeting with management", "note app project" etc.
- ~~in the tags you can also include the author of the note/ quote (it's better to add the author's name and surname as two separate tags) and add a tag with the name of the note source, e.g. book or article title etc.~~
- => you don't have to add tags with source's title, author's first and last name anymore (the crossed paragraph above), because you can add a source separately via source form or note form and I'm suggesting you to do that, because in the near future I'll add the possibility to filter notes by sources, authors & sources types.
- if the content of your note comes from the website, add a source's link to your note via source form
- use built-in markdown editor to format your notes & make them more readable
- you can also **refer to other notes stored in your database using links** (see markdown guide how to do a link), because every note has it's own URL. You can organize/ group your notes this way by particular project or topic => **create notes containing lists of notes links**. The possibilities are endless.
- remember, that you can always go back to any note & update it with the new tags or delete ones

## Motivation (problem I wanted to solve & solution)

I've made this app first of all for my own needs. I read a lot, create a lot (developing different knowledge-based projects) and... do a lot of notes:

- using different techniques, like: mindmapping, sketchnoting, Cornell Note Taking method
- noting on different materials, like: paper, books pages, phone, laptop
- storing notes... everywhere

So...

### Problem

I couldn't manage & organize thousands of my paper & digital notes properly (I have developed my own system, but it's too far from what I need). So I've tried a few note apps, but none of them where satisfying - something always was missing.

### Solution

I've understood, that I need to:

- have all notes (paper & digital) in one place
- organize them by tags, because my paper notes were in so many folders and places & also sometimes some notes were needed to be in a few project folders in the same time

So I've decided to build this note app & solved one of my biggest problems thanks to my own app. Now my notes will be tagged, organized & easy to find/ filter.

And when I've tested the app, I've decided to share it with the world to let everybody to build an easy to use, but effiecient knowledge/ notes base! Sign up & try here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/!

## Future of the app

This app in its current form will stay stable, so you can safely use it.

But soonly linky_notes & my [todo-app](https://vadimgierko.github.io/todo-app/) will be combined into one complex app, published on custom domain, enabling:
- adding tasks
- adding lists
- adding tasks to notes or lists, notes to tasks or lists
- defining sources types (like: book, magazine, article, blog, web page, web platform, multimedia etc.)
- defining notes types (like: quotes, ideas, personal, definition, question etc.)
- filtering notes not only by tags, but also by sources, authors, sources and notes types etc.
and much more!
